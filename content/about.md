# Crystal of Unstable Darkness

:Formatter{:id=42293 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042293" :grade-type=4 text="Crystal of Unstable Darkness" :sub-id=0} and its ingredients are one of the rarest, if not the rarest, items in the game. The player that manages to obtain all 4 of its ingredients will be able to synthesize it and obtain a :Formatter{:id=42289 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/03_Quest_Item/00042080" :grade-type=4 text="Kzarka Summon Scroll" :sub-id=0} and more importantly, choose between one of the three:

- :Formatter{:id=45260 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/07_ProductMaterial/00045260" :grade-type=3 text="Splendid Alchemy Stone of Protection" :sub-id=0}
- :Formatter{:id=45228 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/07_ProductMaterial/00045228" :grade-type=3 text="Splendid Alchemy Stone of Destruction" :sub-id=0}
- :Formatter{:id=45292 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/07_ProductMaterial/00045292" :grade-type=3 text="Splendid Alchemy Stone of Life" :sub-id=0}

## How to craft the Crystal of Unstable Darkness

In order to be able to craft :Formatter{:id=2871 db-type="processing-recipe" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042293" :grade-type=4 text="Crystal of Unstable Darkness" :sub-id=-1} you'll have to combine:

- :Formatter{:id=42294 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042294" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Depravity" :sub-id=0}
- :Formatter{:id=42295 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042295" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Corruption" :sub-id=0}
- :Formatter{:id=42296 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042296" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Wickedness" :sub-id=0}
- :Formatter{:id=42297 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042297" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Repugnance" :sub-id=0}
  and then synthesize them using simple alchemy. Once the item is crafted you can accept the quest :Formatter{:id=2051 db-type="quest" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042293" :grade-type=0 text="[Alchemy] Incomplete Evil God" :sub-id=20} and exchange the crystal for :Formatter{:id=42289 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/03_Quest_Item/00042080" :grade-type=4 text="Kzarka Summon Scroll" :sub-id=0}. After that you'll be given a guaranteed :Formatter{:id=15991 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/00015991" :grade-type=3 text="Kzarka's Sealed Weapon Box" :sub-id=0} and also be able to choose between the before mentioned Splendid Alchemy Stones.

## How to obtain the ingredients

Actually obtaining the ingredients is where the real challenge lies. Many myths surround the aquisition of these ingredients, but this will give you a final answer whether they are even obtainable and if they are, how to obtain them.

### Item 1: Crystal of Corruption

:Formatter{:id=42295 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042295" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Corruption" :sub-id=0} is the first ingredient of the Crystal of Unstable Darkness. It can be obtained by doing alchemy. With each alchemy craft you do you have a chance to roll a rare byproduct group. The chance for rolling that group varies based on mastery and is between 2% at 0 mastery and 4% at 2000 mastery. On each successful roll of that group you then have a `~0.0001%` of actually obtaining :Formatter{:id=42295 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042295" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Corruption" :sub-id=0}.

### Item 2: Crystal of Wickedness

The second ingredient, :Formatter{:id=42296 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042296" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Wickedness" :sub-id=0} can be obtained by grinding down any type of alchemy stone or spirit stone. You can find the recipes and yields for every stone in the "Product of Processing Recipe" tab of :Formatter{:id=42296 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042296" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Wickedness" :sub-id=0}. The chances of obtaining the second crystal are very low as well with a droprate of `0.0001%` per successful grinding process.

### Item 3: Crystal of Repugnance

Instead of needing to destroy alchemy stones like for the last item, :Formatter{:id=42297 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042297" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Repugnance" :sub-id=0} can be obtained crafting new alchemy stones or spirit stones. In order to create new alchemy stones you need to combine:

- 10x :Formatter{:id=9733 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/07_ProductMaterial/00009733" :grade-type=0 text="Shining Powder" :sub-id=0}
- 3x :Formatter{:id=6354 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/07_ProductMaterial/00006354" :grade-type=0 text="Sinner's Blood" :sub-id=0}
- 5x :Formatter{:id=4805 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/07_ProductMaterial/00004805" :grade-type=0 text="Powder of Time" :sub-id=0}
- 10x :Formatter{:id=5302 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/07_ProductMaterial/00005302" :grade-type=0 text="Pure Powder Reagent" :sub-id=0}
- 10x :Formatter{:id=5301 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/07_ProductMaterial/00005301" :grade-type=0 text="Clear Liquid Reagent" :sub-id=0}

This will then either give you:

- :Formatter{:id=45201 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/07_ProductMaterial/00045201" :grade-type=0 text="Imperfect Alchemy Stone of Destruction" :sub-id=0}
- :Formatter{:id=45233 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/07_ProductMaterial/00045233" :grade-type=0 text="Imperfect Alchemy Stone of Protection" :sub-id=0}
- :Formatter{:id=45265 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/07_ProductMaterial/00045265" :grade-type=0 text="Imperfect Alchemy Stone of Life" :sub-id=0}
- :Formatter{:id=9734 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/07_ProductMaterial/00009734" :grade-type=0 text="Broken Alchemy Stone Shard" :sub-id=0}
- or with a `0.0001%` chance :Formatter{:id=42297 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042297" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Repugnance" :sub-id=0}

Note that the 3 Imperfect Alchemy Stones could then be broken down again for a chance to obtain :Formatter{:id=42296 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042296" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Wickedness" :sub-id=0}.

You could also try to obtain :Formatter{:id=42297 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042297" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Repugnance" :sub-id=0} by crafting Spirit Stones, the recipe for all them can be found on the database page of the Crystal of Repugnance under "Product of Recipe".

### Item 4: Crystal of Depravity

Now onto the final ingredient, :Formatter{:id=42294 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042294" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Depravity" :sub-id=0} which is by far the hardest to obtain.

The reason for that is the fact that it's only obtainable via turning in Imperial Alchemy Boxes. Each day you have a limit that dictates how many of those you can deliver. The formula for that limit is: `contribution points / 2`. Combine that with a drop rate of `0.0001%` per box and you'll see it takes a serious amount of time to obtain the final ingredient.

To make things much worse though it can only be obtained by turning in the old Imperial Alchemy Boxes. Some of you may have never even heard about them as the rework of those boxes happend back in 2019. Instead of boxes being grouped by skill level like Guru, Master etc. every meal/elixir had its own box like this one :Formatter{:id=9826 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/07_ProductMaterial/00009826" :grade-type=1 text="Professional's Sturdy Alchemy Box" :sub-id=0}. Unless you for some reason have a insane stockpile of those old boxes left your chances of every dropping :Formatter{:id=42294 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042294" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Depravity" :sub-id=0} are basically 0.

## Conclusion

To wrap things up, getting all 4 required pieces for the Crystal of Unstable Darkness is a extremely hard task. And even that is probably an understatement. Let's hope the developers add :Formatter{:id=42294 db-type="item" icon-image="New_Icon/03_ETC/04_DropItem/00042294" :grade-type=3 text="Crystal of Depravity" :sub-id=0} to the current Imperial Alchemy Boxes so that atleast it becomes theoretically possible to obtain all 4 pieces.
